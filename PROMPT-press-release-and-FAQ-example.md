Prompt:
I'm developing a new product using "working backwards" approach. Help me create the initial press release and FAQ document based on the following information:

Product concept: _Brief description of your product idea_

Target customers: _Description of who will use this product_

Key problem being solved: _What pain point or challenge does this address?_

Unique value proposition: _How is this different/better than existing solutions?_

Key features: _List 3-5 main capabilities or features_

Using this information, please:
1. Draft a concise press release (1-2 paragraphs) announcing this product as if it has just launched
2. Create a compelling headline for the press release
3. Include a quote from a fictional customer explaining how this product solved their problem
4. Develop an FAQ section with 5-7 questions that potential customers might ask, along with clear answers
5. Suggest 2-3 important questions I might have overlooked that customers would want answered

Please format this as a complete document I could share with my product team to align on our vision before development begins.
