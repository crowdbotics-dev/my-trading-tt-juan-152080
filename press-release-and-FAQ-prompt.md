I'm developing a new product using Amazon's "working backwards" approach. Help me create the initial press release and FAQ document based on the following information: 
 - Product concept: LLM Agents to automate scalping and trading Cryptocurrencies Target customers: Traders, Bitcoin enthusiasts 
-  Key problem being solved: There are many indicators to have in mind when doing scalping or trading. This product has many agents that evaluate different indicators at the same time, then perform some predictions with the combinations of the indicators, and choose the one with the most higher winning chances.
- Unique value proposition: This product uses the power of the LLM Agents to evaluate multiple things at the same time, and decide which one is better at the right moment. 
- Key features: Multiple indicator evaluations, multiple strategy evaluations, probability evaluations, automated trading. 

Using this information, please: 
1. Draft a concise press release (1-2 paragraphs) announcing this product as if it has just launched 
2. Create a compelling headline for the press release 
3. Include a quote from a fictional customer explaining how this product solved their problem 
4. Develop an FAQ section with 5-7 questions that potential customers might ask, along with clear answers 
5. Suggest 2-3 important questions I might have overlooked that customers would want answered Please format this as a complete document I could share with my product team to align on our vision before development begins.
